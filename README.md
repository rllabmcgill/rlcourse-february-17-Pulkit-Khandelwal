Please go through the following IPthon Notebook first which details the theory and presents the results for the Windy Grid World (No Importance Sampling Ratio):

https://github.com/rllabmcgill/rlcourse-february-17-Pulkit-Khandelwal/blob/master/n_step_windy_grid.ipynb

The rest of the three Notebooks details the code and results for the remaining three cases as presented in the class.


Multi-step bootstrapping and TD Control Methods.
n-step Q(sigma), Tree Backup Algorithm, n-step SARSA, n-step expected SARSA, SARSA, Expected SARSA and Q-Learning

Author: Pulkit Khandelwal

Future Work:

As discussed with Pierre-Luc Bacon, I will make the changes to the Q(sigma) algorithm for Assignment 4.
